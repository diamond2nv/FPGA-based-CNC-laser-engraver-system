# FPGA-based-CNC-laser-engraver-system
FPGA based CNC Laser Engraver System - 2019 Implemented a VHDL design in BASYS3 FPGA board that can communicates with a computer and cut through thin paper and engrave pictures on a piece of wood using a laser head. The project has alsoa security system that shuts down the laser output in emergency cases and a VGA screen output thatshows the state of the printing and the coordinates of the stepper motors. This project is selected asthe best project among 192 projects for 2019-2020 Fall term Digital Design EEE102 course in Bilkent University.
